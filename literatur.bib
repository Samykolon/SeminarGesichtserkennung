	abstract = "In this paper, an efficient algorithm for human face detection and facial feature extraction is devised. Firstly, the location of the face regions is detected using the genetic algorithm and the eigenface technique. The genetic algorithm is applied to search for possible face regions in an image, while the eigenface technique is used to determine the fitness of the regions. As the genetic algorithm is computationally intensive, the searching space is reduced and limited to the eye regions so that the required timing is greatly reduced. Possible face candidates are then further verified by measuring their symmetries and determining the existence of the different facial features. Furthermore, in order to improve the level of detection reliability in our approach, the lighting effect and orientation of the faces are considered and solved."

	abstract = {An original approach is presented for the localisation of objects in an image which approach is neuronal and has two steps. In the first step, a rough localisation is performed by presenting each pixel with its neighbourhood to a neural net which is able to indicate whether this pixel and its neighbourhood are the image of the search object. This first filter does not discriminate for position. From its result, areas which might contain an image of the object can be selected. In the second step, these areas are presented to another neural net which can determine the exact position of the object in each area. This algorithm is applied to the problem of localising faces in images.},
